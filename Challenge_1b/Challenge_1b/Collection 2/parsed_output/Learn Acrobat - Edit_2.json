      "content": "Editing a scanned PDF can be complicated if it includes low-quality text or images, non- editable text, line breaks, or complex formatting. Other inhibiting factors include compatibility  issues, security restrictions, and large file sizes, which are more prevalent in PDFs created from  scanned images.\nTo streamline the process, consider the following best practices and guidelines before editing  a scanned document:\nCheck the accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) output . When you open a  scanned document, Acrobat  automatically runs OCR  in the background to make the  document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is  accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the  Scan & OCR  >  Recognize  Text  tool to improve the output.\nEnhance image quality . If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the  Enhance  scanned file  or  Enhance camera image  feature to improve the quality of images before  attempting to edit the document. For more information, see  Scan documents to PDF .\nUse the correct font and formatting . When editing the document, ensure that the font and  formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't  have the desired fonts on your computer, see  Add fonts to your computer .\nRemove security restrictions . If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing,  remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove  security from a PDF, see  Unlock a PDF .\nAvoid editing complex elements . If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images,  avoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements.\nCheck for compatibility issues . Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is  compatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe  Acrobat. For more information, see  System requirements .\nSave a backup copy . Always save a backup copy of the original scanned PDF before making  any edits. Revert to the original document if any issues arise during the editing process.",
