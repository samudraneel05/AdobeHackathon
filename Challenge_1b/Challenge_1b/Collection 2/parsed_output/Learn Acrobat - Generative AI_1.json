      "content": "Overview of generative AI features  Use the generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader to quickly scan through  lengthy, complex PDF content and get answers or generate a summary.    Note:  The generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support English, French,  German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or Japanese. To understand the governing terms,  review Adobe's Generative AI User Guidelines. To understand Adobe's data handling  practices, see Content usage and handling practices.    The AI-powered features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support multiple document types,  including PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, TXT, and RTF files. AI Assistant supports Microsoft Teams and  Zoom meeting transcripts. The capabilities improve comprehension and save time across  various document types.\nAI Assistant quickly gets answers to your questions based on your documents in a  comprehensive and informative way. It can analyze multiple documents to uncover  similarities, differences, and key patterns. With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests,  such as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table  sources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the  primary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more  accurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations. It can extract information  accurately from tables and complex documents.    Generative summary automatically provides an outline with headings and summaries to  highlight key points in the document. The feature generates key insights that help you easily  comprehend the PDF content. For a speedier response, it processes PDF content in chunks  and simultaneously streams summaries.    You can access the generative AI features in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Acrobat desktop  on both Windows and macOS, on Acrobat online, and within Acrobat extensions for Google\nChrome or Microsoft Edge. AI Assistant is also available on phones through Acrobat mobile  apps (iOS and Android). It isn't available on iPad or Android tablets.       Benefits of generative AI features  The generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader significantly improve  comprehension, help you get insights, and produce high-quality content quickly. Here are the  main benefits.\n-   Improved comprehension:  You can better understand complex PDF documents  because the features provide insights and more context around the content.  -   Enhanced productivity : Work across multiple PDFs and documents in various formats,  including Teams and Zoom meeting transcripts, streamlining your workflow and  saving time for higher-priority tasks.  -   Impactful content : You can use the content suggestions that the features generate for  impactful emails, presentations, meeting notes, and more.    Turn off generative AI features  The generative AI features in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader are turned on by default. However,  you can choose to turn them off, if necessary. If you're an admin, you can revoke access to  generative AI features for your team or org by contacting Adobe Customer Care.    User Guidelines\nUser Guidelines governing your access and use of Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI  features are found here.\nIn addition, please always use your judgment to evaluate generated output and any source  attributions. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI features are built upon powerful,  emerging large language model technologies that may generate outputs that are inaccurate  or misleading, or otherwise reflect content that does not represent Adobe\u2019s views. This is  especially true if you try to use these features to generate outputs that are unrelated to your  source document.\nDo not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of  professional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting  your own independent consultation or research. Generative AI features cannot replace  advice provided by a qualified professional and do not form any such relationship (for  example, an attorney-client relationship).",

      "heading": "Attributions",
      "content": "When the AI Assistant analyzes a document, it identifies sentences most likely to support the  answer to your question. Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful\ncues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is  powered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all  answers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers  to your questions \u2014 even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI  Assistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation  or cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on  where the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated  responses.\nPlease note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is  different than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In  such scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive  clickable citations in the response.",
