You require server  access to use them.\nALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document  recipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients  from LDAP directories.\nUse ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening,  editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers.",

      "heading": "Why validate a digital signature?",
      "content": "When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the  signer and the signed content. Depending on how you\u2019ve configured your application,  validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the  authenticity of the signature\u2019s digital ID certificate status and document integrity.\nTo verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are  trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or  Acrobat Reader settings.\nTo verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after  signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.\nSet preferences for validating digital signatures\nYou can set verification preferences in advance so digital signatures are valid when you open  a PDF and verification details appear with the signature. When Digital Signatures are  validated, an icon appears in the document message bar to indicate the signature status.\n1.   Select the hamburger menu     (Windows\u00ae), or go to  Acrobat  (macOS)>  Preferences .\n2.   In the Preferences dialog box, from under categories, select  Signatures .\n3.   From the  Verification  box in the  Digital Signatures  panel, select  More...\n4.   In the 'Signature Verification Preferences' dialog that opens, you can control the\nfollowing settings:\n\u2022   Set automatic validation of signatures : With the  Verify signatures when the  document is opened  check box selected, Acrobat automatically validates all  signatures in a PDF when you open the document.\n\u2022   Set verification behavior:  The options specify methods that determine  which plug-in to choose when verifying a signature. The appropriate plug-in  is often selected automatically. Contact your system administrator about  specific plug-in requirements for validating signatures.\n\u2022   Check the revocation status of certificates : With the  Require certificate  revocation checking to succeed...  checkbox selected, Acrobat checks  certificates against a list of excluded certificates during validation. If you  deselect the check box, the revocation status for Acrobat Approval\nsignatures is ignored. The revocation status is always checked to certify  signatures.\n\u2022   Use expired timestamps : The option is selected by default. It u ses the time  mentioned in the timestamp or embedded in the signature, even if the  signature\u2019s certificate has expired. If you deselect the check box, Acrobat  discards expired timestamps.\n\u2022   Set verification for time : You can select the appropriate options under  'Verification time' to check the time at which the signature was created, to  check the timestamp embedded in the signature, or to check the current  time.\n\u2022   Add verification information : Select appropriate options under 'Verification  information' to add verification information to the signed PDF or to alert the  user when the verification information is too large.\n\u2022   Configure to trust the root certificates in the Windows\u00ae certificate store :  You can specify whether to trust all root certificates in the Windows\u00ae  Certificates store for:\n\u2022   Validating signatures : Certificates are trusted for Acrobat Approval  signature validation.\n\u2022   Validating certified documents : Certificates are trusted for  certification signature validation.",

This feature analyzes the  document for content that may alter the look and feel of the document and suppresses such  content to allow you to view and sign the document in a static and secure state.\nBy signing in preview mode, you can f ind if the document contains:\n\u2022   Any dynamic content or external dependencies.\n\u2022   Any constructs such as form fields, multimedia, or JavaScript\u2122 that may affect its look  and feel.\nAfter reviewing the report, you can contact the author of the document about the problems  listed in the report.",

To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation  must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the  document signing process or added afterward.\nIf certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a  limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked.  When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing  revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable.\nThe necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate  revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing,  the signature can be validated without requiring external resources.\nAcrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF  creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger  menu     (Windows) or the  Acrobat  menu (macOS) >  Save as other  >  Acrobat Reader  extended PDF .\nNote:  Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp  server.
