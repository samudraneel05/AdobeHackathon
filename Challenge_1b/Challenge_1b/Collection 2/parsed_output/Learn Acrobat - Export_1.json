      "content": "The Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by  incrementally, and at regular intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original  file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the  changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new  information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the  autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes  of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is  especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments.\nYou can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you  close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted.",
