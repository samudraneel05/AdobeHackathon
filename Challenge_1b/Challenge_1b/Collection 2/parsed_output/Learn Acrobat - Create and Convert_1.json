      "content": "You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign\u00ae  files, digital images, and more. Di\ufb00erent types of sources have di\ufb00erent tools available for PDF  conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in  the Print dialog box.\nIf a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft  Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is  already open, you don\u2019t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF.\nEvery PDF balances e\ufb03ciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the  balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an  appropriate conversion method.\nFor example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat  applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings.  If you want more control over the process, you\u2019ll want to use another method.",

      "heading": "Balance PDF file size and quality",
      "content": "You can select various settings to ensure that your PDF has the best balance between file size,  resolution, conformity to specific standards, and other factors. The settings you select depend  on your goals for the PDF that you are creating. For example, a PDF intended for high-quality\ncommercial printing requires di\ufb00erent settings than a PDF intended only for onscreen viewing  and quick downloading over the Internet.\nOnce selected, these settings apply across PDFMaker, Acrobat, and  Acrobat Distiller .  However, some settings are limited to specific contexts or file types. For example, PDFMaker  options can vary among the di\ufb00erent types of  Microsoft O\ufb03ce  applications.\nFor convenience, you can select one of the conversion presets available in Acrobat. You can  also create, define, save, and reuse custom presets that are uniquely suited to your purposes.\nFor scanned documents, you can choose from Autodetect Color Mode or several scanning  presets that are optimized for scanning documents and images in color or black and white.  You can modify these presets or use your own custom scanning settings.\nThere are various ways to create a PDF file using Acrobat. You can generate a PDF quickly  using the convert to PDF tool, menu commands, dragging-and-dropping files onto the  Acrobat application icon, or converting clipboard data.",
