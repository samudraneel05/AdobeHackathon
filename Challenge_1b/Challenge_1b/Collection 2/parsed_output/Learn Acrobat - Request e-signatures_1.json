To place a signature or another field, click at the  desired location in the document and then set the field's properties from its context  menu.\n\u2022   Simplified mode for multiple signers  This mode provides simplified authoring with the capability of assigning fields to  multiple signers. When you select a signer from the right pane and add fields in the  form, the fields are assigned to the signer. That means those fields will be available to  the signer for filling the information and signing the form.\n\u2022   You can switch the assignee of any field using the floating toolbar. The assigned colors  to the signers make it easy to distinguish the fields for respective signers.\n\u2022   Advanced mode for multiple signers   If you've added multiple signers, you see the options as shown below. Click\nthe   button to place the detected form fields in the PDF document. Alternatively,  drag fields from the tabs in the right pane and drop the fields where desired in the  document.\nNote:   You can switch between simplified mode and advanced mode for multiple signers.

The document is\nsent for signature to the recipients and a confirmation notice is displayed.\nYou receive an email from Acrobat Sign stating that the agreements have been sent to the  first signer for signature. The first signer also receives an email with a link to sign the  agreement. When the signer adds his or her signature in the signature field and then clicks  the  Click to sign  button, the agreement is sent to the next signer with a link to sign, and so  on. Once the agreement is signed by all the signers, everyone gets a copy of the signed  agreement.\nAll your signed documents are kept at one place and you can access them from anywhere.",

      "content": "A signer receives an email with a link to sign the agreement. Also, if the signer uses Acrobat or  Acrobat Reader desktop application, the signer sees a notification that an agreement has  been shared for signing.\nNote:  Signers are not required to sign up or purchase any Adobe product to sign agreements.  They can sign agreements using a web browser, mobile device, or Acrobat / Acrobat Reader  desktop application.\nSend in bulk  allows you to upload a form and use that as a template to create and send many  (hundreds!) of unique agreements, each dedicated to one external signer. Each agreement is  insulated from the others and contains its own audit report. Each recipient is unaware of all  other recipients.\nThe sender has access to the agreements through their Home or Documents tab or through  the  Send in bulk  template, which contains an Agreements report that tracks the overall status  of the child agreements created from the template. Additionally, the sender can export the  field-level data of all completed agreements in a CSV format using the Download Form Field  Data action.    To access the Send in bulk feature, do one of the following:\n\u2022   In the Acrobat desktop app, go to the  Tools  center ,  scroll down to the  E-Sign   section,  and then select  Send in bulk .\n\u2022   Sign in to  Acrobat online , select the  E-Sign  menu in the top navigation bar, and then  select  Send in bulk .\nSteps to send in bulk\n1.   Select the  Send in Bulk  tool as explained earlier. The Send in bulk file upload page  is displayed.\n2.   Add a file :\nUpload (by search or drag-and-drop) the primary file that you are using to build  your agreement template.\nThe selector on the right of the  Select a file  button allows you to choose from the  source where the file resides. The default is your local system.\nOnce a file is selected, the configuration page loads.\n3.   Add participants :\n1. List the participants required.\n\u2022   The  Sign  action is assigned by default.\n\u2022   The  Sign  action allows the participant to enter field data and sign the  agreement.\n\u2022   Up to 50 participants are supported.\n\u2022   Each participant listed receives their own agreement.\n2. Enter recipient email addresses followed by commas, or copy and paste a list of  email addresses into the Email field.\n3. Configure participant authentication by clicking the key icon to the right of the  participant.\n\u2022   Email  is the default authentication method for confirming the identity of each  participant and is sufficient to obtain a legal signature in most cases.\nPassword  authentication can be added to increase security. When configured, the participant  must enter the password before they can interact with the agreement.\n4.   . (Optional) Add yourself and/or CC'd parties\n\u2022   Click  Add me  to add yourself as a counter signer.\n\u2022   Click  Add cc  to add people you want to be copied when the agreement is sent  and complete.\n5.   (Optional) Add additional files if needed.\nThe initial file selected to start the agreement template is already attached.\nUpload any additional file(s) that you require.\n\u2022   Multiple files can be uploaded.\n\u2022   All files uploaded are concatenated into one file for the final agreement.\n\u2022   The order the files are listed dictates how the final agreement will look.\n\u2022   You can click and drag the files to sort them.\n\u2022   You must share this password with the participants out-of-band.\n6.   Add Agreement Details:\n\u2022   Name your agreement. All agreements generated from the  Send in  bulk  template will have the same agreement name.\n\u2022   Change the default text in the  Message  field as appropriate.\n7.   Edit the Agreement settings  (Optional):\nBy default, agreements do not require a password to view the completed agreement,  nor do they have reminders set for participants\n\u2022   Select  Add access password  if you require recipients to enter a password to  open and view the signed PDF file.\n\u2022   Select  Set Reminder  to set the frequency of reminders to be sent until the  agreement is completed.\n8.   Click  Next  in the upper right corner of the window.\nThe document is now ready to add any fields that you want the signers to fill in or sign.\nNote:    If you have added multiple files, the files are converted into PDFs and combined into a  single document. The combined document is opened for you to add fields.\n9.   Prepare the Agreement and Add Fields:\nYou can now add any necessary fields to the agreement. Remember that  a  Signature  field must be placed for each signer (including internal counter-singers).\nThere are two methods to apply fields:\n1.  Simple Authoring  is loaded by default in most instances. Simple authoring:\n\u2022   Is limited to the most common types of fields:\n\u2022   Text input (All Text fields are flagged as Required)\n\u2022   Signature\n\u2022   Signer's name (Printed)\n\u2022   Signer's email\n\u2022   Signature date (Read-Only; Supplied by the system)\n\u2022   Checkbox\n\u2022   Places fields anywhere you click on the document.\n\u2022   Allows resizing of fields by clicking the bottom right corner of the field (blue  triangle) and dragging the field to size.\n2.

      "content": "Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions,  require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed  electronically, it's important that recipients can:\n\u2022   Verify document authenticity\u2014confirming the identity of each person who signed the  document\n\u2022   Verify document integrity\u2014confirming that the document has not been altered in  transit\nCertificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and  governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within  their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity  validation. Examples include:\nFor instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or  qualified electronic signature requirements in  eIDAS e-signature regulation  or the  ETSI PAdES  standard  (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures).",

Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to  forge because it contains encrypted information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily  verified and informs recipients whether the document was modified after the signer initially  signed it.\nTo sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a  self-signed digital ID in Acrobat or  Acrobat Reader . The digital ID contains a private key and a  certificate with a public key, and more. The private key is used to create the certificate-based\nsignature. The certificate is a credential that is automatically applied to the signed document.  The signature is verified when recipients open the document.\nWhen you apply a certificate-based signature, Acrobat uses a hashing algorithm to generate a  message digest, which it encrypts using your private key.

The server acts as an ideal location to store user certificates in enterprises that  use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers,  including  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  (LDAP) servers. After you locate a  certificate, you can add it to your list of trusted identities so that you don\u2019t have to look it up  again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your  workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup.\nFor more information about directory servers, see the  Digital Signature Guide .",

Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures\nYou can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based  signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp  authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and  reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party  timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID.\nTimestamps appear in the signature field and in the  Signature Properties  dialog box. If a  timestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the  Signature  Properties  dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the  local time of the computer at the moment of signing.\nNote:  If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one  later to your signature. (See  Establish long-term signature validation .) A timestamp applied  after signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server.",
