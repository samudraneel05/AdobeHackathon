It could be a paper form or PDF that  hasn\u2019t been optimized for form filling. The Fill & Sign tool automatically detects the  form fields like text fields, comb fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. You can  manually add text and other symbols anywhere on the form using the Fill & Sign tool if  required.\nYou can complete the forms by entering information and adding your signatures. Acrobat  also allows you to send your completed forms to others and securely save them in Adobe  cloud storage.",
